# Physical addresses of memory variables in the stages leading up to the main kernel's usage
Type	Addr.	Description
b	0x0500	BIOS boot drive number
b	0x0502	Console width, characters
b	0x0504	Console height, characters
w	0x0506	Current console output position (0 at top-left, increases by 1 each character to the right and wraps to the left side of the next line) (limitation: limits console from having more than or equal to 2^15 character spaces because it is shifted left during prints)
b	0x0508	Current console formatting
w	0x050a	Physical address of beginning of main console divided by 16 (Euclidean division) (limitation: Address mod 16 must equal 0, limitation: address must not be greater than 1048560 because of overflow)






b	0x050c	Implicit carriage return in console when line feed (0=no,1=yes)

l	0x0510	Physical address of start of GDT
w	0x0514	Bug check code

l	0x0518	Physical address of beginning of main console # TODO implement
64bit	0x07f0	GDT entry bitmap; the first bit is for the entry at offset 0x08, the second bit is for the entry at offset 0x10, &c.
LGDTd32	0x07fa	LGDT descriptor data
GDT	0x0800	Start of GDT
LIDTd32	0x000073fa	LIDT descriptor data
STAKTOP	0x0007f7f4	(Appriximate) top-of-stack (value of %esp when the stack is empty) of the interrupt-handling stack
l	0x0007f7f8	Address of farRunELF within segment of GDT index 0x0008
l	0x0007f7fc	Value 0x00000008
IDT	0x0007f800	IDT, 2048 bytes
STAKTOP	0x00800000	Top-of-stack of the second-stage kernel during boot and when handling int $0x80 system calls

TSS		0x00000c00	TSS for interrupt 0x71
TSS		0x00000c80	TSS for interrupts that should cause the system to issue a "bug check"
TSS		0x00000d00	TSS for IRQ 14 and IRQ 15
TSS		0x00000d80	TSS for the currently-executing userspace program
TSS		0x00000e00	TSS for exception 14
